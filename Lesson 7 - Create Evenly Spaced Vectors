Create Evenly Spaced Vectors
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

Task 1:

It is common to create vectors containing evenly-spaced numbers, such as this vector.
y = [5 6 7 8]
y = 
    5    6    7    8

TASK
Create a row vector named x that contains the values 1, 2, and 3 in that order.

Solution 1:
x = [1 2 3]

Task 2:

For long vectors, entering individual numbers is not practical. An alternative, shorthand method for creating evenly spaced vectors is to use the colon operator (:) and specify only the start and end values.
y = 5:8
y = 
    5    6    7    8
Notice that square brackets are not needed when you use the : operator.

TASK
Create a row vector named y with integer values from 1 to 10, using the : operator.

Solution 2:
y = [1:10]

Task 3:

The : operator uses a default spacing of 1. However, you can specify a different spacing. For example, this command specifies a spacing of 2:
x = 20:2:26
x = 
    20    22    24    26

TASK
Create a row vector named z that starts at 1, ends at 5, with each element separated by 0.5.

Solution 3:
z = 1:0.5:5

Task 4:

TASK
Create a row vector named a that starts at 3 and ends at 13, with each element separated by 2.

Solution 4:
a = 3:2:13

Task 5:

If you know the number of elements you want in a vector (instead of the spacing between each element), you can use the linspace function.
linspace(first,last,number_of_elements)

Note the use of commas (,) to separate inputs to the linspace function.
x = linspace(0,1,5)
x = 
    0    0.250    0.500    0.750    1.000
TASK
Create a row vector named b that starts at 1, ends at 10, and contains 5 elements.

Solution 5:
b = linspace(1,10,5)

Task 6:

Both linspace and the : operator create row vectors. But what if you need a linearly spaced column vector? The transpose operator (') converts a row vector to a column vector.
x = 1:3
x =
    1    2    3

x = x'
x = 
    1
    2
    3
TASK
Transpose b from a row vector to a column vector using the transpose operator.

Solution 6:
b = b'

Task 7:

You can create column vectors in a single command by creating the row vector and transposing it all on one line. Use parentheses to specify the order of operations.
x = (1:2:5)'
x = 
    1
    3
    5
TASK
In a single command, create a column vector named c that starts at 5, ends at 9, and has elements that are spaced by 2.

Solution 7:
c = (5:2:9)'
