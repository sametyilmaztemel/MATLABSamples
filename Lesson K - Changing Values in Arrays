Changing Values in Arrays
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

Task 1:

Remember, you can extract entire columns of arrays by using the : operator.

TASK
Create a vector named v2 containing the last column of data.

Solution 1:
v2 = data(:,end)

Task 2:

You can change the elements in a vector by combining indexing with assignment. This code changes the second element of A to 11.
A(2) = 11

TASK
Change the first element of v2 from NaN to 0.5.

Solution 2:
v2(1) = 0.5

Task 3:

You can also use indexing to change the elements in a matrix. Here are the elements in the matrix data.

Matrix with one NaN element in the top right.

TASK
Change the element in the first row and last column of data to 0.5.

Solution 3:
data(1,end) = 0.5
