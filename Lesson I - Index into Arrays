Index into Arrays
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

Task 1

You can extract values from an array using row-column indexing.
y = A(5,7)
This syntax extracts the value in the 5th row and 7th column of A and assigns the result to the variable y.

TASK
Create a variable x that contains the value in the 6th row and 3rd column of the variable data.

Solution 1:
x = data(6,3)

Task 2:

You can use the MATLAB keyword end as either a row or column index to reference the last element.
y = A(end,2)

TASK
Extract the value in the last row and 3rd column of the variable data by using the end keyword. Assign this value to a variable named y.

y = data(end,3)

Task 3:

You can use arithmetic with the keyword end. For example:
y = A(end-1,end-2)

TASK
Create a variable z that contains the value in the second to last (end-1) row and 3rd column of data.

Solution 3:
z = data(end-1,3)
