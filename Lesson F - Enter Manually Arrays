Manually Enter Arrays
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

Task 1:

In MATLAB, a single number, called a scalar, is represented by a 1-by-1 array, meaning the array contains one row and one column.
TASK
Create a variable named x with a value of 4.

Solution 1:
x = 4

Task 2:

You can create arrays with multiple elements using square brackets.
x = [3 5]
x = 
    3    5

TASK
Create an array named y with two elements: 7 and 9

Solution 2:
y = [7 9]

Task 3:

When you separate numbers by using spaces as shown in the previous task, MATLAB combines the numbers into a row vector, which is an array with one row and multiple columns (1-by-n). When you separate numbers by using semicolons, MATLAB creates a column vector (n-by-1).
x = [1;3]
x = 
    1
    3

TASK
Create an array named z with two elements, 7 and 9, in a single column.

Try copying the previous command and changing the space between the numbers to a semicolon (;).

Solution 3: 
z = [7;9]

Task 4:

TASK
Create a row vector named a that contains the values 3, 10, and 5 in that order.

Solution 4:
a = [3 10 5]

Task 5:

TASK
Create a column vector named b that contains the values 8, 2, and -4 in that order.

Solution 5:
b = [8;2;-4]

Task 6:

You can use a combination of spaces and semicolons to create a matrix, which is an array with multiple rows and columns. When creating a matrix, you enter the elements row by row.
x = [3 4 5; 6 7 8]
x = 
    3    4    5
    6    7    8
TASK
Create a matrix named c with these values.
5    6    7
8    9   10

Solution 6:
c = [5 6 7;8 9 10]

Task 7:

You can perform calculations within the square brackets.
x = [abs(-4) 4^2]
x = 
     4    16
TASK
Create a row vector named d that contains sqrt(10) as the first element and pi^2 (Ï€
2
) as the second element.

Solution 7:
d = [sqrt(10) pi^2]
