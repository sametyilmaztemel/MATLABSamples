Create Arrays with Functions
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

Task 1:

MATLAB contains many functions that create commonly used matrices, such as matrices of random numbers.
x = rand(2)
x = 
    0.8147    0.1270
    0.9058    0.9134
The 2 in the function call rand(2) specifies that the function creates a 2-by-2 matrix of random numbers.
TASK
Create a variable named x that is a 5-by-5 matrix of random numbers.

Solution 1:
x = rand(5)

Task 2:

Many matrix creation functions allow you to input one number to create a square matrix (n-by-n) or input two numbers to create a rectangular matrix (m-by-n).
x = rand(2)
x = 
    0.8147    0.1270
    0.9058    0.9134

x = rand(2,3)
x = 
    0.6324    0.2785    0.9575
    0.0975    0.5469    0.9649
TASK
Create a column vector that contains 5 rows and 1 column by using the rand function. Assign the result to a variable named y.

Solution 2:
y = rand(5,1)


Task 3:

Most array creation functions accept the same inputs as rand. For example, the zeros and ones functions create matrices of all zeros and all ones, respectively.
x = ones(2,3)
x = 
    1    1    1
    1    1    1
TASK
Create a matrix of all zeros that has 6 rows and 3 columns (6-by-3) by using the zeros function. Assign the result to a variable named z.

Solution 3:
z = zeros(6,3)
