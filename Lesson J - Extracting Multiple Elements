Extracting Multiple Elements
Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

Task 1:

When used as an index, the colon operator (:) specifies all the elements in that dimension. For example, this code creates a column vector containing all the elements from the first column of A.
x = A(:,1)

TASK
Create a column vector named density that contains all the elements from the 2nd column of the matrix named data.

Solution 1:
density = data(:,2)

Task 2:

You can use the colon operator to specify a range of values. This code creates a matrix containing the first, second, and third rows of the matrix A.
x = A(1:3,:)

TASK
Create a variable volumes that contains the last two columns of data. You can see the size of data in the output pane to the right of your screen.

Solution 2:
volumes = data(:,3:4)


Task 3:

To index into a vector, use a single index value. For example, this code returns the third element of row or column vector v.
x = v(3)

TASK
Create a variable named p containing the 6th element of the vector density.

Solution 3:
p = density(6)


Task 4:

You can use a single range of index values to reference multiple vector elements. For example, this code returns a subset of vector v containing the elements from index 3 to the end.
x = v(3:end)

TASK
Create a vector named q containing the 2nd through 5th elements of density.

Solution 4:
q = density(2:5)
